    <string name="fruits_food">The following are recommended for your healthy teeth</string>
    <string name="start">HOME</string>
    <string name="apps">Apples are high in fiber and water.
        Eating an apple produces saliva in your mouth,
        which rinses away bacteria
        and food particles.
        </string>
    <string name="carrots">
        Carrots are crunchy and full of fiber.
        Eating a handful of raw carrots at the end of the meal
        increases saliva production in your mouth,
        which reduces your risk of cavities. </string>
    <string name="cheese">Eating cheese raises the pH in the
        mouths and lowers the risk of tooth decay.
        Cheese also contains calcium and protein,
        nutrients that strengthen tooth enamel.</string>
    <string name="greens">Leafy greens such as kale and spinach also promote oral health.
        They are high in calcium, which builds the enamel.
        They also contain folic acid, a type of B vitamin that has numerous health benefits,
        including possibly treating gum disease in pregnant women</string>
    <string name="ds">Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist will help you maintain healthy teeth and gums.

Here are some tips to help you look after your teeth.

    <string name="fg">The best time to brush teeth is after meals.
        Choose a toothbrush with a small head for better access to back teeth.
        Soft bristles are kinder on your gums.</string>
    <string name="paste">Tip 2. Use fluoridated toothpaste.</string>
    <string name="rd">Fluoride helps to harden tooth enamel and reduces your risk of decay.</string>
    <string name="bt">Tip 3. Brush thoroughly.</string>

    <string name="limit">Tip 5.	Limit acidic drinks like soft drinks, cordials and fruit juices.</string>
